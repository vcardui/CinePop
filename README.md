## Project Personal Milestones 
* Learn the difference and how to use absolute and relative routes (place my CSVs and images properly so I could share the project to my classmates and teacher)
* Manipulate CSV files in C# aided by CSVHelper library. Learned how to use it's classes and methods
* Windows Forms common controls setup and usage (Form, ComboBox PictureBox, Label, etc.)
* POO applied to GUIs

## Inspiration for creating this project
This was one of the tasks I did for my Computing Languages II college course final project. In my project, I had to present along with my teamates the topic "CSV files" in C#. I did this program as an excersice example for the presentation.

I wanted to make a real life example of the CSV's capabilities, so I came up with the idea of a Movie Ticket Store after actually looking at my local movie theater shedule.
